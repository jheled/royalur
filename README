The Royal Game of Ur: The Classic Version
=========================================

Code for playing analyzing and exploring the Royal Game of Ur (classic rules).

Read about the game and code at https://jheled.github.io/royalur/.

Installation:
=============

WE ARE TRANSITIONING TO PYTHON 3. REPO MIGHT BE BROKEN AT THE MOMENT

You can install directly from github using pip:

>>> pip install -e git+https://github.com/jheled/royalur.git#egg=royalur

Or download the recent distribution from

>>> wget https://filedn.com/llztAlmJ0zvkPa8QEheU5n5/royalur-0.2.0.tar.gz

Both the distribution and github are missing the database file, which is too big
for github and too big regardless. If you want to run with Ishtar (and you do),
download the file from pCloud and place it in the data/ directory.

>>> cd data; wget https://filedn.com/llztAlmJ0zvkPa8QEheU5n5/db16.bin


If you cloned the respository or downloaded the distribution you need to install
this python package by running 'python setup.py install'.

To install locally run 'python setup.py install --home=DIR', and add 'DIR/lib/python'
to the PYTHONPATH environment variable.

For example:
  python3 setup.py install  --home=./`python3 --version 2>&1 | sed -s "s/Python /version-/"`
