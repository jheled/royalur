The Royal Game of Ur: The Classic Version
=========================================

Code for playing analyzing and exploring the Royal Game of Ur (classic rules).

Read about the game and code at https://jheled.github.io/royalur/.

Installation:
=============

WE ARE TRANSITIONING TO PYTHON 3. REPO MIGHT BE BROKEN AT THE MOMENT

You can download a recent distribution from

>>> wget https://filedn.com/llztAlmJ0zvkPa8QEheU5n5/royalur-0.2.0.tar.gz

Both the distribution and github are missing the database file, which is too big
for github and too big regardless. If you want to run with Ishtar (and you do),
download the file from pCloud and place it in the royalur/data/ directory.

>>> cd data; wget https://filedn.com/llztAlmJ0zvkPa8QEheU5n5/db16.bin

If you cloned the respository or downloaded the distribution you need to install
this python package by running 'python setup.py bdist_wheel' and "pip install" the
file you just built.

When installing the wheel, by default no additional dependencies are installed.
This is sufficient to execute the core library. To run the GUI application on any system,
the Pillow package needs to be installed. To run the command-line
curses-based application on Windows, the windows-curses package needs to be installed.

These options may be specified as:
>>> pip install 'dist\royalur-0.2.1.rc1-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl[curses]'
>>> pip install 'dist\royalur-0.2.1.rc1-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl[Pillow]'
>>> pip install 'dist\royalur-0.2.1.rc1-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl[curses,Pillow]'
