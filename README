The Royal Game of Ur: The Classic Version
=========================================

Code for exploring, analyzing and playing the  Royal Game of Ur (classic version).

See the docs at https://jheled.github.io/royalur/.

Download the recent distribution from  https://github.com/jheled/royalur/dist/.

The game database file is too big for github and too big regardless. If you want to run with Ishtar
(and you do), download the file from pCloud and place it in the data/ directory.

>>> cd data; wget https://filedn.com/llztAlmJ0zvkPa8QEheU5n5/db16.bin
